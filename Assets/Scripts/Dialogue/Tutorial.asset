    responses:
    - responseText: Are you talking to me?

            dialogueText: Johnny ran away from me this morning. I opened the door,
              and out he went. I know he loves this place, but I just can't track
              him down through all of this foliage.
            responses:
            - responseText: Your son is missing? Sounds more like a job for the police.
                Did you call them?
              nextNode:
                dialogueText: "Well, he is my kid, but\u2026 he isn\u2019t a human.
                  Johnny\u2019s my cat."
                responses:
                - responseText: No kidding. Your cat loves being in the forest?

                    dialogueText: "Johnny just loves it. Runs around wreaking havoc
                      on the plants and critters. Now that I think of it, though,
                      it might not be the best for the local ecosystem. The guy\u2019s
                      a real apex predator, and I read online that house cats can
                      be menaces to birds. Anyways it would be such a relief if you
                      could find him for me. I'm sorry though, I can't offer a reward
                      or anyting... Do you still want to help?"

                        like?"

                          brown, with long fluffy fur and a handsome disposition.
                          Basically, he looks like a cat."
                - responseText: Ok, now I understand. I can help.

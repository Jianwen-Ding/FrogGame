Well, about time you showed up; the local wildlife isn’t gonna study itself! Come on, let me get you going on your first job. What do you know about the art of catching frogs? #speaker:Sarah
* [Pretty much nothing.]
    Don’t worry, we all start somewhere. #speaker:Sarah

* [Well, I do like frogs…]

It’s fairly difficult, given all of the jumping and whatnot. So don’t worry, I won’t make you do that on day one. What I will have you do, though, is some population surveying. #speaker:Sarah
* [What does that mean?]

A population survey is a regular exercise we do to track the population numbers of all our local amphibian species. Think of it as a way to check the general pulse of the ecosystem; not enough frogs, we might have a predator problem. Too many frogs, we might have a lack-of-predators problem. #speaker:Sarah
* [Ok, I think I understand.]
    -> knot3
* [You can have too many frogs? I thought it was our job to keep them safe.]
    Think of our ecosystem like a delicate puzzle, kid. Any one piece gets out of whack, and everything else suffers. A frog eutopia might sound fun to you at first, but pretty soon the forest would run out of insects to be eaten. No insects, and the plants suffer. See the problem? #speaker:Sarah

Recently, our frogs have been hit pretty hard. I know the counts are low, so you have to let me know just how low. #speaker:Sarah
* [What’s killing these frogs?]
    A combination of things; invasive species, loss of habitat, pollution. Some of it is out of our hands, but I know we can make a difference with our work. When you’re out there, use [Q] or [E] to throw bait to distract the frogs. In the meantime you can run into the frogs to mark them. We need to mark as much frogs a possible by the end of the day. #speaker:Sarah
    ** [How should I find them?]
        Try to find out what they eat, how they move, and where they congregate most. You can't stay in one spot either, or else you just end up marking the same frogs over and over.  #speaker:Sarah
        *** [Got it.]
            Oh, and one last thing. If you’re having trouble, look at the ground. Frogs leave some pretty distinct footprints in the dirt. #speaker:Sarah

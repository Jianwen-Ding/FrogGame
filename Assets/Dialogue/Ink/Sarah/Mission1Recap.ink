How is marking frogs going? #speaker:Sarah
* [Going pretty poorly :(]
    Donâ€™t worry, we all start somewhere. #speaker:Sarah
    -> knot1
* [Going great!]
    Awesome! #speaker:Sarah
    -> DONE

Well, what's your issue? #speaker:Sarah
* [I don't know where to check.]
    -> knot2
* [They always run away.]

Try finding what frogs like to eat in order to find where they congregate. This info should be logged in the speciespedia when you sight new animals. Press [P] to accsess it. #speaker:Sarah
* [Ok, I think I understand.]
Good luck!

Try to avoid being heard by crouch walking towards the frogs.
Also, try to avoid being seen by the frogs by hiding behind bushes.
Once within range, throw out some bait and let the frog eat it before seizing the moment by tagging the frog!#speaker:Sarah
* [Ok, I think I understand.]
Good luck!

I just spoke with Timmy. You think you know where the fox is? #speaker:Sarah
* [Yeah, he’s definitely sleeping in a den at (INSERT LOCATION HERE).]

    Well, let’s go with that theory for now. #speaker:Sarah

Tonight, I need you to camp out and set up a trap for our friend. Timmy will give you a cage-trap and some bait to use, and you’ll have to wait for the fox to come out. #speaker:Sarah
* [What if he doesn’t go into the cage?]
    Don't worry, we’ll regroup and try again. But I’ve got a good feeling about this. #speaker:Sarah
    -> knot2
* [Sounds good.]

Once you catch him, bring the cage back to HQ; I can take over from there. You just worry about the catch! #speaker:Sarah
* [You got it, boss.]

I see an invasive fox in there. #speaker:Sarah
* [He was a pretty hard catch for my first day.]
    Good, Iâ€™ll take him upstate to a forest where he actually belongs. Poor guy is probably scared right now. Hopefully the frogs here can start to bounce back and reproduce without an invasive predator in their way. #speaker:Sarah

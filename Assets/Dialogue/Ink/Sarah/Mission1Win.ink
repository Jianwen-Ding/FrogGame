Gimme the report. #speaker:Sarah

    ** [Not good?]
        No, not really. The population decrease is even worse than the projections. #speaker:Sarah
        *** [Do you know why?]
            It’s not your fault; you can blame climate change and human intervention for the decrease. But you can help us fix it.
            ****[How should I do that!]
            I'll tell you later. For now, ill let you take a rest if you want. If you stay out too long, you're going to collapse and fall asleep anyways. There should be a nice couch to fall asleep on in our base. I'll wait for you here.

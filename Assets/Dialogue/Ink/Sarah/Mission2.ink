One of the largest culprits in the decline of our frog population is a nearby pair of foxes. There've been sightings starting two months ago and we’ve been finding his victims ever since. #speaker:Sarah

    Normally they don’t. But this red fox isn’t local - he must’ve been pushed here from deforestation or rising temperatures. And if you haven’t noticed, we don’t have any alpha predators to take care of it naturally. #speaker:Sarah
    ** [So what do we do?]

        So far... but if they started repopulating, we could be in serious trouble. You can imagine how quickly they would start dominating the ecosystem! #speaker:Sarah

We can't quite just catch and relocate these foxes yet. First, we need to confirm their species and check if they have any cubs that also need to be relocated. Afterwards, we can borrow Timmy's equipment to catch them.  #speaker:Sarah

* [Could it try to attack me?]
    No, foxes are generally skittish and won’t come near a human willingly. Remember, you're much bigger than they are. #speaker:Sarah

To be honest, dealing with invasive species isn't really my specialty. Timmy's our expert. He’s always out there logging the enviorment. I think you'll be able to gain some more insight about fox behavior if you talk to him.
* [Roger that!]
    Good luck! Come back if you have any questions. #speaker:Sarah

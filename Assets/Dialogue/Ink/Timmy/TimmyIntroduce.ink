Hello. #speaker:???
* [Hi, you must be Timmy.]
    And you must be the rookie. Nice to meet ya! I have a task for you. #speaker:Timmy
        ** [And what is that?]
            If you press [P] you should be able to pull out a speciespedia. It's a handy tool we use to track information about the various animals we work with. If you click on each of the tabs you should see an empty entry on each. #speaker:Timmy
            *** [Do you want me to fill them in?]
                Exactly. The information you'll fill in on the speciespedia should prove invaluable in the tasks Sarah will give you.   #speaker:Timmy

In paticular, try to log information on foxes, frogs, and fireflies. #speaker:Timmy
* [How should I log them in the speciespedia]
    For foxes and frogs, you need to distract them with bait and touch them in order to automatically log them in the speciespedia. For fireflies you just need to move near them. Got it? #speaker:Timmy
    ** [Yeah, I got it!]

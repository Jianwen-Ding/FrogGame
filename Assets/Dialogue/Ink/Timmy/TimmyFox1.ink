It seems like you got everything down! I’ve got some catching materials for you, kid! #speaker:Timmy

    Do you know who you’re talking to? Back in the old days, I used to be a pro. #speaker:Timmy

I think I’ve got a plan for tonight. You can't catch the fox when they're sleeping with their cubs; dens can lead in tunnels that are up to 75 ft long! Individually chasing them in an open will also be a pain. Wait until 16:00 at their den location and catch them when they wake up! #speaker:Timmy
* [Wait, I have to chase the fox?]
    Don't worry, he’s probably tiny. Just make yourself big and aggressive, and he’ll have no chance. #speaker:Timmy
        ** [Ok, I’ll do it.]
            That’s the spirit, rookie! #speaker:Timmy

You better get going. Don’t want to be here all day. #speaker:Timmy

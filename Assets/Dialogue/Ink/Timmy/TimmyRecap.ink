Try to log information on foxes, frogs, and fireflies on your speciespedia.
Access the speciespedia by pressing [P] and clicking on the different tabs of the book. #speaker:Timmy
* [How should I log animals into the speciespedia]
    For foxes and frogs, you need to distract them with bait (Use [Q] or [E] and touch them in order to automatically log them in the speciespedia. For fireflies you just need to move near them. Got it? #speaker:Timmy
    ** [Yeah, I got it!]

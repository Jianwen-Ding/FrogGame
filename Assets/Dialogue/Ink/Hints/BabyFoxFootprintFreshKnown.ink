You can see outlines of tracks. There are tiny claw marks surrounding a rounded pattern imprinted into the ground, along with tufts of red fur. #speaker:Tracks
    * [These must belong to a fox!]
        These tracks look much smaller than usual. They were likely made by an infant. This must mean that the foxes near us have cubs! #speaker:Tracks
        **[These footprints look fresh!]
         Fox cubs were playing near here. I suspect that den near this track is currently being inhabited!#speaker:Tracks

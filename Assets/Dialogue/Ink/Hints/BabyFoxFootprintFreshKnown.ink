You can see outlines of tracks. You can see tiny little claw marks surrounding a rounded pattern imprinted into the ground along with red fur. #speaker:Tracks

        These tracks look much smaller than usual. Almost like it was made by cub. This must mean that the foxes near us actually have cubs! #speaker:Tracks
        **[These footprints look fresh!]

You can see outlines of tracks. There are tiny claw marks surrounding a rounded pattern imprinted into the ground, along with tufts of red fur. #speaker:Tracks

        The tracks don't indicate that this animal was going in any paticular direction. They look fresh, suggesting that the animal was here at most one night ago.

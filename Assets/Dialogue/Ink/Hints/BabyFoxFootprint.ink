You can see outlines of tracks. You can see tiny little claw marks surrounding a rounded pattern imprinted into the ground along with red fur. #speaker:Tracks

        The tracks don't indicate that this animal was going in any paticular direction. The tracks look fresh, like the animal was here at most one night ago.
